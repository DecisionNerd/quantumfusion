# quantumfusion
multi-data-type fact clustering

Quantumfusion is a Python project designed to perform unsupervised machine learning for clustering facts—assertions that can span multiple data types—within a single, unified vector space. By representing diverse data-type assertions (such as numerical, categorical, textual, or relational facts) as vectors, quantumfusion enables the discovery of patterns, similarities, and groupings among heterogeneous facts without relying on labeled data. This unified approach empowers robust data curation, integration, and knowledge discovery across varied sources and formats, all utilizing the rich ecosystem of Python tools.
